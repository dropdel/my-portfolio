            <p>Hello, I'm Derrick, a software developer.
                I specialize in planning, designing and developing
                software products. Currently, I'm intensely focused 
                on fleshing out my portfolio, so if you need something
                done: I'm your guy. 
            </p>
            <p>As I've worked with a variety of tools and frameworks,
                relevant to web development, I feel as if I'm capable
                of fulfilling whatever requirements for the web you need.

            </p>
